!regress AVO on CC and the CC x DERS interaction
!this is the main effect of CC on AVO when DERS is at its mean 
!(as long as you z-scored or mean-centered DERS)
!AVO on LNB_sc; 
!this is the interaction effect -- 
!indicates whether effect of DERS on AVO varies according to level of CC
!AVO on CCxDERS;
